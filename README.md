# US Airports


Airport data was retrieved from the USGS. The data were derived from an extract of the Public-Use Airports database of the National Transportation Atlas Databases-2010 (NTAD-2010), published by the Bureau of Transportation Statistics, Department of Transportation.

The U.S. state shapefile was aquired from Mike Bostock of D3. Within each state, there is a field counting the number of airports per state. This count is visually displayed in the map and can also be found by clicking on each state.
