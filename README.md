# U.S. Airports

This map displays airports in the United States with an enplanement of 25 or more passengers per year. The map distinguishes between airports with and without control towers and emphasizes those airports with greater than 1,000,000 passengers per year.

Airport data was retrieved from the USGS. The data were derived from an extract of the Public-Use Airports database of the National Transportation Atlas Databases-2010 (NTAD-2010), published by the Bureau of Transportation Statistics, Department of Transportation.

The U.S. state shapefile was aquired from Mike Bostock of D3. Within each state, there is a field counting the number of airports per state. This count is visually displayed in the map and can also be found by clicking on each state.
